# CSE472 Fake News Detector Project

Using Python and it's various packages, we created a program that uses machine learning algorithms that help detect fake news sources.

# IDE

Pycharm

# Getting Started 

You need to make sure the files test.csv and train.csv are in the same directory as the source code. Put them in the same project folder.

There are many libraries that needs to be installed in order for the program to work. In the project folder, there is a file called requirements.txt where all the libraries/packages are listed. The following command line will install all the packages/libraries from the requirements.txt file needed to run the code. You will use the Pycharm terminal at the bottom of the screen to type in the following command line. 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After installing all the necessary packages and libraries, run the program as usual and a result.csv file should appear in your directory. Running the program may take around a minute to fully execute
