# CSE472 Fake News Detector Project

Using Python and it's various packages, we created a program that uses machine learning algorithms that help detect fake news sources.

# Introduction

All over the world, there are hundreds of different news outlets that publish concurrent world events or sports information to the public. But since there are so many outlets giving out similar content, the validity of the articles published may be in jeopardy. There are well-known news companies like Wall Street Journal and the New York Times that are for sure going to publish content that is certain to be true while others post information that can be misleading or even completely false. Reading news that is misleading and false is very common around the world. People tend to believe anything that they read in the newspaper or online articles but they donâ€™t check the source that these published content is from. Therefore, these people will believe in fake news causing confusion among the people. That is where, for this project, we are creating a Python program that helps detect these fake publications and articles using machine learning algorithms and strategies. Using the Mean Squared Error, we categorize each news site into four categories: false, misleading, true, and uncertain.

# Getting Started 

Since there are many libraries that needs to be installed in order for the program to work. These command lines will install the necessary libraries

`> pip install -r requirements.txt`
